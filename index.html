                <h2><li class="project"><a href="https://github.com/radheysharma/Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning">Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</a></li></h2>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>This a project aimed at leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood 
                    of cardiovascular diseases in individuals based on various health parameters (such as age, gender, 
                    height, weight) and risk factors (such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, 
                    glucose, smoking/drinking habits, activity). This project seeks to develop accurate predictive 
                    models that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment 
                    planning. Through the fusion of data science and healthcare, this endeavor aims to contribute to 
                    preventive medicine, potentially saving lives and improving overall public health outcomes.</p>
